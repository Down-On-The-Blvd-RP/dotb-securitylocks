        id = "store_247_1",
        doors = {
            {coords = vector3(373.875, 327.882, 103.566), heading = 0.0}  -- Door 1 location
        },
        locked = true,
        autoLockTime = {lock = 20, unlock = 8},  -- Auto-lock after 20 minutes, unlock at 8am
        breakInRequiredItems = {"lockpick", "weapon_crowbar"},
        notifyJobs = {"police", "securoserv"},  -- Notifications for these jobs
        fireAlarm = true  -- Send fire alarm if explosion happens
    }

   Players can interact with doors to lock or unlock them based on their configuration.
